# Toonify-opencv-c
Toonify seeks to emulate the types of cel-shading effects offered by graphics engines in a lighthearted and userfriendly way.

The goal of this project is to create an Open CV app with a simple user interface allowing users to apply the cartoon algorithm to images of their choice. The algorithm is designed to provide artistically and comically appealing results on as wide a range of pictures as possible, although it is conceded that not all inputs will yield equally satisfying results.The process to produce the cartoon effect is divided into two branches- one for detecting and boldening the edges, and one for smoothing and quantizing the colors in the image. At the end, the resulting images are combined to achieve the effect.
